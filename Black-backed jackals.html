			<h1>Black-backed jackal</h1>
		<p>The black-backed jackal is a member of the dog family. It has a rusty red coat with a black patch on its bacck and a black-tipped tail. It measures around 95 centimetres (37 inches) from head to tail.</p>
	<p>As opportunistic omnivores , jackals eat what they can . They work in family packs to hunt small antelopes, but they'll also feed on reptiles,insects,birds,fruits,berries and carcasses left by larger predators</p>	
	<p>There are two distinct populations of black-backed reptiles in Africe-one in East Africa(Kenya , Ethopia,and Tanzania) and one in southern Africa (Namibia,Angola ad South Africa</p>
	<p>These animals live in a wide variety of habitats, from deserts to grasslands to savannahs.The IUNC lists them as least concern,meaning they face few threats.However,they are hunted by farmers who kill them to protect their livestock.</p>
